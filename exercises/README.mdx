# Get Started with React üèÉ‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è

üë®‚Äçüíº Hello! I'm Peter the Project Manager and I'm here to help you know what our
users want you to know so you can build the kind of React application they need!
In this workshop we're going to give you the foundational knowledge you need
upon which you can build your React skills.

Our users don't need much at the start of this workshop ("Hello World" is about
as far as we'll get for a bit), but they'll need custom components with props
soon which are the building blocks of React applications. We'll cover all of
that and more in this series of exercises.

It's important that you understand the fundamentals of React so you can not just
use React, but _understand_ it. This will help you build better applications and
be more effective at debugging when things go wrong.

With that, let's get started!

	NOTE: all the exercises in this workshop are in `index.html` files to keep
	things as simple as possible. The JavaScript you write will be inside inline
	`<script>` tags. This is just to keep things simple for this workshop, but in
	other workshops you'll be writing TypeScript 100% to make things resemble real
	world applications.
